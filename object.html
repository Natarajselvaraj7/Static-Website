                    <p class="content1">
                        Dairying is an important source of subsidiary income to small/marginal farmers and agricultural labourers. 
                        The manure from animals provides a good source of organic matter for improving soil fertility and crop yields.
                         The gober gas from the dung is used as fuel for domestic purposes as also for running engines for drawing water from well.
                          The surplus fodder and agricultural by-products are gainfully utilised for feeding the animals. 
                          Almost all draught power for farm operations and transportation is supplied by bullocks. Since agriculture is mostly seasonal, 
                          there is a possibility of finding employment throughout the year for many persons through dairy farming. 
                          Thus, dairy also provides employment throughout the year. 
                          The main beneficiaries of dairy programmes are small/marginal farmers and landless  labourers. 
                        A farmer can earn a gross surplus of about Rs. 12,000 per year from a unit consisting of 2 milking buffaloes. 
                        The capital investment required for purchase of 2 buffaloes is Rs. 18,223/-. Even after paying a sum of Rs. 4294/- per annum
                         towards repayment of the loan and interest the farmer can earn a net surplus of Rs. 6000 - 9000/- approximately per year.
                       (For details see model scheme enclosed). Even more profits can be earned depending upon the breed of animal, 
                         managerial skills and marketing potential.
                         According to World Bank estimates about 75 per cent of India's 940 million people are in 5.87 million villages, cultivating over 145 million hectares of cropland.
